# UpstreamOS - Foundation for Special Purpose Linux Distributions

**Status: WIP**

UpstreamOS is a common set of packages and tools that could be used to build your own Linux distribution.

Based on the powerful NixOS toolchains, we have a focus on:

  * Easy to understand. No hidden magic. Users could always figure out how one package is being built by reading the source code.
  * Easy to customize. Adding/Removing/Replacing packages should be easy tasks.
  * Easy to use. The only dependency is the Nix package manager. The rest could be built from source or fetched from cache when needed.

You can not do much with the current code base. We're adding more packages and a minimal Linux distribution demo for usage. Stay tuned.
